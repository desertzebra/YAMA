Yet Another Moodle Api(YAMA) provides an alternative Object Oriented(OO) layer to extend and create new and improved course management modules using MOODLE. YAMA provides instances of models and utilities, to enable the developers to focus on quick implementation of their custom business logic and views, while using MOODLE as an underlying storage and processing engine. It masks the very powerful and complex underlying architecture of MOODLE providing a core group of functionalities for course management.
